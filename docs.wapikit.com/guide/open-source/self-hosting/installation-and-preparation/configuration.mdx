## Setting up Postgres

WapiKit uses Postgres as its database. You can either install Postgres on your local machine or use a managed Postgres service like AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or Heroku Postgres.

### Installing Postgres

You can install Postgres by following the instructions on the [official Postgres website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

### Using Docker

If you don't want to install Postgres on your local machine, you can use Docker to run a Postgres container.

```bash
docker run -d -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES
_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres postgres
```

This command will download the Postgres image from Docker Hub and run a Postgres container on port 5432 with the default username and password.

## Setting up Redis

WapiKit uses Redis for caching and rate limiting. You can either install Redis on your local machine or use a managed Redis service like RedisLabs, AWS Elasticache, or Google Cloud Memorystore.

### Installing Redis

You can install Redis by following the instructions on the [official Redis website](https://redis.io/download).

### Using Docker

If you don't want to install Redis on your local machine, you can use Docker to run a Redis container.

```bash
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis
```

This command will download the Redis image from Docker Hub and run a Redis container on port 6379.

## Configuring WapiKit

After setting up Redis and Postgres, you need to configure WapiKit to connect to these services. You can do this by editing the `config.toml` file in the WapiKit directory.

```toml
[database]
url = "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/wapikit"

[redis]
url = "redis://localhost:6379"
```


{/* applying the db migrations */}

Replace the database and Redis URLs with the appropriate values for your setup.

## Next Steps

Now that you have configured resources, you can proceed with the installation process. Follow the [installation guide](/guide/installation-and-preparation/installation) to set up WapiKit on your local machine or server.
